# Cringeface Orchestrator - Architecture Overview

## 1. Purpose
The Cringeface Orchestrator is responsible for managing and executing AI tasks across multiple services, ensuring smooth communication, dependency resolution, and efficient processing.

## 2. Execution Flow Overview
The orchestrator follows a **queue-based asynchronous execution model** to ensure scalability and modularity. Below is the execution pipeline:

### 2.1. High-Level Flow
1. **Custom Chat App** sends user queries or requests.
2. **Orchestrator** receives the request and determines the processing flow.
3. **Queue System** stores tasks for execution (e.g., Celery, Kafka).
4. Tasks are assigned to appropriate services:
   - **NLP Module** processes text.
   - **Computer Vision** handles image/video inputs.
   - **Audio Recognition** transcribes spoken input.
5. **Speech Synthesis** generates output if needed.
6. **Real-Time Data Sync** ensures consistency across services.
7. The **Orchestrator aggregates results** and sends them back to the **Custom Chat App**.

### 2.2. Sync vs. Async Execution
- **Synchronous Tasks:** REST/gRPC-based calls for low-latency interactions.
- **Asynchronous Tasks:** Message queues (Kafka, Celery) for long-running tasks.

### 2.3. Dependency & Priority Management
- Tasks with dependencies (e.g., NLP â†’ Speech Synthesis) are handled sequentially.
- Priority handling ensures urgent tasks are executed first.

## 3. Service Communication Protocols
| Service          | Communication Method |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| NLP            | REST (JSON)          |
| Speech Synthesis | REST (JSON)          |
| Computer Vision | gRPC (Protobuf)      |
| Audio Recognition | REST (JSON)          |
| Real-Time Data Sync | WebSockets        |

## 4. Future Considerations
- Expand error handling (retries, failover mechanisms).
- Improve performance using distributed task processing.

## 5. Next Steps
- Implement the **Service Coordination Mechanism** (Task Queues & Priorities).
- Expand error handling mechanisms with **circuit breakers**.
- Begin integrating FastAPI endpoints for service interaction.
