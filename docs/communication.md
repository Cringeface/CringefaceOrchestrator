# Communication Protocols for Cringeface Orchestrator

## Purpose
Defines how microservices and external stakeholders interact to ensure modularity, scalability, and real-time collaboration.

## 1. Internal Communication (AI-to-AI & AI-to-Human)
### 1.1. Protocols
- **REST (JSON)**: Used for simple, stateless requests (e.g., NLP → Speech Synthesis for text-to-speech).
- **gRPC (Protobuf)**: Used for high-performance, low-latency needs (e.g., Computer Vision → Real-Time Data Sync for image analysis).
- **WebSockets**: Optional for real-time updates (e.g., Custom Chat App syncing with Real-Time Data Sync).

### 1.2. Service Interactions
| Source Service       | Target Service       | Protocol | Data Format    | Example Use Case                     |
|----------------------|----------------------|----------|----------------|--------------------------------------|
| NLP                  | Speech Synthesis     | REST     | JSON           | Send text for voice output.          |
| Computer Vision      | Real-Time Data Sync  | gRPC     | Protobuf       | Stream analysis results.             |
| Audio Recognition    | NLP                  | REST     | JSON           | Pass transcribed text.               |
| Custom Chat App      | All Services         | WebSockets | JSON           | Real-time user queries.              |

### 1.3. Dynamic Service Interactions
- **Message Queues**: Use RabbitMQ or Kafka for asynchronous communication (e.g., Audio Recognition publishes ‘text_transcribed’ events to Kafka, consumed by NLP, triggering ‘response_generated’ events sent to Speech Synthesis via RabbitMQ).
- **Event-Driven Triggers**: Leverage WebSockets for real-time updates in Custom Chat App, and Firebase listeners for Real-Time Data Sync to push data across services instantly.

### 1.4. Data Flow Diagram
- `[User Audio] → [Audio Recognition] → [NLP] → [Speech Synthesis] → [Custom Chat App (Playback)]`
- `[User Image] → [Computer Vision] → [Real-Time Data Sync] → [Custom Chat App (Display)]`
- Real-Time Data Sync uses Firebase to store and sync user context (e.g., chat history, preferences) across services.

### 1.5. Error Handling & Recovery
- **Circuit Breakers**: Use `pybreaker` or `hystrix-python` to prevent cascading failures (e.g., block Computer Vision requests if it fails, retry after recovery).
- **Adaptive Throttling**: Rate-limit cloud service calls (e.g., Azure, OpenAI) with fallbacks to local models (PyTorch, OpenVINO) to avoid rate limits.
- **Retries and Fallbacks**: Implement 3 retries with exponential backoff, falling back to local models if cloud services fail.
- **Logging**: Log errors to Firebase with timestamps, service IDs, and error codes for debugging.

## 2. External Communication (Stakeholder Interactions)
### 2.1. Protocols
- **REST (JSON)**: For stakeholder APIs (e.g., Cringeface LLC dashboards).
- **Email/Reports**: Periodic updates (e.g., PDF via MS Teams).

### 2.2. Access
- Stakeholders access via OAuth or API keys (TBD).
- Sayle maintains, tracked in Git commits.

## 3. Standards & Formatting
- All data in JSON (REST) or Protobuf (gRPC).
- WebSockets use JSON for real-time messages (e.g., `{ "event": "text_transcribed", "data": "Hello" }`).
- Markdown for this document, versioned in GitHub.

## 4. Access & Updates
- Maintained by Sayle, reviewed by Grok and Addison.
- Changes tracked via Git commits (tagged with ClickUp Task #124).

## 5. Future Considerations
- **Scalability**: Evaluate bottlenecks (e.g., Real-Time Data Sync under high load, WebSockets latency) and modular improvements (e.g., Docker/Kubernetes scaling, load-balanced message queues).
- **Security**: Add API key authentication, TLS for all traffic, and OAuth for external stakeholders.
