# Communication Protocols for Cringeface Orchestrator

## Purpose
Defines how microservices and external stakeholders interact to ensure modularity, scalability, and real-time collaboration.

## 1. Internal Communication (AI-to-AI & AI-to-Human)
### 1.1. Protocols
- **REST (JSON)**: Used for simple, stateless requests (e.g., NLP → Speech Synthesis for text-to-speech).
- **gRPC (Protobuf)**: Used for high-performance, low-latency needs (e.g., Computer Vision → Real-Time Data Sync for image analysis).
- **WebSockets**: Optional for real-time updates (e.g., Custom Chat App syncing with Real-Time Data Sync).

### 1.2. Service Interactions
| Source Service       | Target Service       | Protocol | Data Format    | Example Use Case                     |
|----------------------|----------------------|----------|----------------|--------------------------------------|
| NLP                  | Speech Synthesis     | REST     | JSON           | Send text for voice output.          |
| Computer Vision      | Real-Time Data Sync  | gRPC     | Protobuf       | Stream analysis results.             |
| Audio Recognition    | NLP                  | REST     | JSON           | Pass transcribed text.               |
| Custom Chat App      | All Services         | WebSockets | JSON           | Real-time user queries.              |

### 1.3. Error Handling & Recovery
- **Retries**: Define max retries (e.g., 3) for failed API calls.
- **Fallbacks**: Switch to local models if cloud services fail (e.g., Azure → PyTorch).
- **Logging**: Use Firebase to log errors with timestamps and service IDs.
- **TBD**: Addison to refine with specific mechanisms (e.g., circuit breakers).

## 2. External Communication (Stakeholder Interactions)
### 2.1. Protocols
- **REST (JSON)**: For stakeholder APIs (e.g., Cringeface LLC dashboards).
- **Email/Reports**: Periodic updates (e.g., PDF via MS Teams).

### 2.2. Access
- Stakeholders access via OAuth or API keys (TBD).
- Sayle maintains, tracked in Git commits.

## 3. Standards & Formatting
- All data in JSON (REST) or Protobuf (gRPC).
- Markdown for this document, versioned in GitHub.

## 4. Access & Updates
- Maintained by Sayle, reviewed by Grok and Addison.
- Changes tracked via Git commits (tagged with ClickUp Task #124).

## 5. Future Considerations
- Scalability: Evaluate WebSockets for all real-time needs.
- Security: Add API key authentication, TLS for all traffic.
