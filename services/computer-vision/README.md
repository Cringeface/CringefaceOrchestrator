# Computer Vision Service
## Purpose
Analyzes images and videos using local or cloud-based computer vision models.

## Responsibilities
- Perform object detection, facial recognition, or image classification.
- Support local models (PyTorch, OpenVINO) and cloud services (Azure Cognitive Services).
- Provide analysis results for human-AI collaboration.

## Inputs
- Image/video files from users (via Custom Chat App).
- Real-time streams (future capability).
- Context from Real-Time Data Sync (Firebase).

## Outputs
- Analyzed data (e.g., JSON with labels) to NLP, Real-Time Data Sync, or Custom Chat App.
- Optional annotated images.

## Technologies
- Python
- PyTorch (local models), OpenVINO (optimized inference), Azure Cognitive Services (cloud)
- Firebase for real-time data
- REST (FastAPI) or gRPC for communication
